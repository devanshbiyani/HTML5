        HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
         It is the fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
         <br>The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.
         <br>It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG),
         <br>a consortium of the major browser vendors(Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).
        <br>HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. 
        <br>Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans
        <br>and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity;
        <br>and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
        <br>HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

        <h2 style="background-color:gainsboro; text-align:center; font-family:century;">Advantages</h2>
        <p style="background-color:aliceblue; text-align:left; font-size:18px;">
            <b>1.<u>Cleaner markup/ Improved code:</u></b><br>
HTML5 will enable web designers to use cleaner, neater code. We can remove div tags and replace them with semantic HTML5 elements.
<br>
<br>
<b>2.<u>Elegant forms:</u></b><br>
HTML5 enables designer to use fancier forms. There will be different type of inputs, search and different fields for different purpose.
<br>
<br>
<b>3.<u>Consistency:</u></b><br>
As websites will adopt the new HTML5 elements we will see more consistency in terms of HTML used to code a web page on one site compared to another.
This will make it much easier for designers and developers to immediately understand how a web page is created.
<br>
<br>
<b>4.<u>Supports rich media elements:</u></b><br>
HTML5 has an inbuilt capability to play audio and video and so we can bid goodbye to those plugin tags.
<br>
<br>
<b>5.<u>Offline Application Cache:</u></b><br>
HTML5 offers an offline application cache facility which will load the page the user has visited even if the user is temporarily offline.
This feature will help the files to load much faster and reduces load on server.

<h2 style="background-color:gainsboro; text-align:center; font-family:century;">Uses</h2>
<p style="background-color:aliceblue; text-align:left; font-size:18px;">
    <b>1.<u>Intro of audio and video:</u></b><br>
    Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5.
    It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their website.
    HTML5 video can use CSS and CSS3 to style the video tag.
    You can change the border, opacity, reflections, gradients, transitions, transformations, and even animations.
    HTML5 makes adding video super-fast and without having to build a video player.
    This saves time for the developer and offers the client a superior and more affordable solution.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>2.<u>Vector Graphics:</u></b><br>
    This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites.
    It can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS.
    Vector graphics are scalable, easy to create and edit. It also supports interactivity and animation.
    Having a smaller file size makes transferring and loading graphics much faster on the web.
    That's the reason why many people prefer to use vector graphics.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>3.<u>Figure and Figcaption:</u></b><br>
    HTML5 allows to use a (figure) element to mark up a photo in a document, and a (figcaption) element to define a caption for the photo.
    The (figcaption) tag defines a caption for a (figure) element.
    This tag provides a container for content that is equivalent to a figure.
    It can be used to group a caption with one or more images, a block of code, or other content.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>4.<u>Progress tag:</u></b><br>
    The progress tag is used to check the progress of a task during the execution.
    Progress tag can be used with the conjunction of JavaScript.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>5.<u>Placeholder Attribute:</u></b><br>
    The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field/text area.
    The short hint is displayed in the field before the user enters a value.
